This GUI application allows you to extract text from images in .jpg or .png format using the Tesseract OCR engine. The extracted text is saved as a .txt file in a destination folder. The extracted text will be saved in the destination folder as a .txt file with the specified name. Each image in the folder will have its text saved sequentially, preceded by a label such as "Screenshot 1," "Screenshot 2," etc.

How to Use the Application

Select the Image Folder: Click the "Select image folder" button. Choose the folder containing your .jpg or .png images. The path to the selected folder will appear next to the button.

Select the Destination Folder: Click the "Select destination folder" button. Choose the folder where the resulting text file will be saved. The path to the selected folder will appear next to the button.

Name the Output File: Enter a name for the output .txt file in the "Name of file" entry box. You do not need to include the .txt extensionâ€”it will be added automatically.

Start the Conversion Process: Click the "Start conversion" button. The application will process the images, extract the text, and save it as a .txt file in the destination folder.

Notes and Warnings

- Configuration File: Ensure you have a Configuration.txt file that specifies the path to the Tesseract OCR engine. Without this file, the application cannot perform text extraction.

- Output File Naming: If a file with the same name already exists in the destination folder, the application will append a unique number (e.g., _1, _2) to the new file's name to avoid overwriting.

Errors and Troubleshooting:

- If the Tesseract OCR engine is not installed or the configuration file is missing, the application will display a "File not Found Error."

- If any other error occurs during processing, an "OS Error" will appear. Ensure the input images are accessible and valid.
